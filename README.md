# STL Overhang Analyzer

## Overview
STL Overhang Analyzer is a user-friendly tool designed to ease the 3D printing process by automating the tedious task of manual support placement. By accurately identifying overhanging parts in STL files (the task often failed by slicers such as Wanhao and Chitubox), this application not only saves time but also improves the printing success rate. It utilizes C++ for high-efficiency calculations and Python for a seamless graphical user interface, making it accessible to everyone.

## Features
- **Automatic Overhang Detection**: Quickly scans STL files to highlight all overhanging sections that require supports.
- **Visualization**: Offers a visual representation of the STL file, with overhangs prominently marked, facilitating easy inspection and planning.
- **Customizable Slicing Parameters**: Allows users to adjust slicing parameters for more precise control over the detection process.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on multiple operating systems, ensuring wide accessibility.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- C++ compiler (GCC for Linux/Mac, MSVC for Windows)
